This project is an extension to the built-in Arena Web Services. It provides a new API endpoint through which the internal Arena API can still be accessed. This package also provides extra functionality to extend the Arena Web Services API as well as allows 3rd party DLLs to provide even more functionality by dynamically adding references to new DLLs at run-time.
